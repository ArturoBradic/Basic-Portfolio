                    <p>Arturo "Artie" Bradic was born in Mexico City in 1995 and immigrated to the U.S. at the age of 5. 
                        He grew up in Northwest Arkansas and eventually moved to Tucson, AZ to pursue a Neuroscience and
                        Cognitive Science degree at the University of Arizona. After graduating and working in medicine
                        for 2 years, he realized pursuing medical school was not the right path for him and switched

                            and development. Na√Øve or ambitious? We'll find out soon...</p>
